    Thank you for visiting our website. This app was created by a group of passionnate programmers with a background in education. We saw the need for a way teachers can access, create, and share successful strategies for their students.

  <p class="about-paragraph">
    More than that, this app can be paired with a simple student quiz app. Students answer a few questions with their Google accounts and responses get sent to their course as both attendance and student data.

  <p class="about-paragraph">
    On a higher-level, this app will be able to provide education researchers data on strategies, predicted and actual grades, graduation rates, and survey data.
