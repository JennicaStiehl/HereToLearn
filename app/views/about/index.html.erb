      Thank you for visiting our website. This app was created by a group of passionnate programmers at Turing School of Software & Design. We all have a background in education and chose to create a product that could help other teachers. Our initial idea was to create a way for teachers to access, create, and share successful strategies for their students. It grew into much more.

      Our app pairs with a simple student quiz app. Students answer a few questions with their Google accounts and responses get sent to their teacher's account as both attendance and student data.

      On a higher-level, this app will be able to provide education researchers with data on strategies, predicted and actual grades, graduation rates, and survey data.
